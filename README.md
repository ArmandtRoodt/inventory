# inventory
A very simple inventory web app to tinker with node.js.

# What does it use.
- Currently uses SQLite3 as the DBMS. 
- Uses the Express minimalist web framework.


This is purely just for me to play with Node.js and not intended to be used in production.
Most of the above will change as I continue to tinker.
